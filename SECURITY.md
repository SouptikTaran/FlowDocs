# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The FlowDocs team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### üö® How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues by:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred):
   - Go to our [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/SouptikTaran/FlowDocs/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Email**:
   - Send details to: security@flowdocs.com
   - Use PGP encryption if possible (key available on request)

### üìã What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Assessment of the potential impact
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
- **Your Contact Info**: So we can follow up with questions

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: At least weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity and severity

### üèÜ Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help make FlowDocs safer:

- **Hall of Fame**: Recognition in our security acknowledgments
- **CVE Credit**: Proper attribution for discovered vulnerabilities
- **Direct Communication**: Work directly with our security team

## üõ°Ô∏è Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| 0.x.x   | ‚ùå No              |

## üîê Security Measures

### In Development
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes require review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security analysis of code
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for type safety and error prevention

### In Production
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication via Clerk
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Security Headers**: Appropriate security headers configured

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logs**: Security-relevant actions logged
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data
- **Regular Backups**: Secure backup procedures

## üîß Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize outputs and use Content Security Policy
- **CSRF Protection**: Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Authentication**: Never store passwords in plain text
- **Authorization**: Always check permissions before actions

### Dependencies
- **Keep Updated**: Regularly update dependencies
- **Audit Packages**: Review new dependencies for security issues
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only add necessary dependencies
- **Security Scanning**: Use tools like `npm audit`

### Environment Security
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **API Keys**: Rotate API keys regularly
- **Development vs Production**: Separate development and production environments
- **Access Control**: Limit access to production systems

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Client-side API Keys**: Some API keys are necessarily exposed on the client side (Clerk, Liveblocks public keys)
- **Real-time Data**: Real-time collaboration requires careful access control management

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Public Key Design**: Services are designed to work safely with public keys
- **Server-side Validation**: All critical operations validated server-side
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions system in place

## üìö Security Resources

### For Users
- **Account Security**: Use strong, unique passwords
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA when available
- **Suspicious Activity**: Report any suspicious activity immediately
- **Data Sharing**: Be cautious about what data you share in documents

### For Developers
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Follow OWASP security guidelines
- **Security Training**: Stay updated on security best practices
- **Code Review**: Participate in security-focused code reviews
- **Threat Modeling**: Consider security implications of new features

## üîÑ Security Updates

### Update Process
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Fix Development**: Develop and test security fixes
3. **Review**: Security team reviews all fixes
4. **Deployment**: Deploy fixes to production
5. **Notification**: Notify users of security updates

### Communication
- **Security Advisories**: Published for significant vulnerabilities
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes mentioned in release notes
- **User Notifications**: Direct notifications for critical issues

## ü§ù Working with Security Researchers

We welcome security research and responsible disclosure:

### Guidelines for Researchers
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Follow responsible disclosure practices
- **No Harm**: Don't cause damage or access user data unnecessarily
- **Good Faith**: Research conducted in good faith
- **Compliance**: Follow applicable laws and regulations

### What We Commit To
- **Timely Response**: Respond promptly to reports
- **Fair Treatment**: Treat researchers with respect
- **No Legal Action**: No legal action for good faith research
- **Public Recognition**: Credit researchers (if desired)
